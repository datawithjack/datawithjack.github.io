    Hi, I’m Jack Frank Andrew, a Data Analyst and Power BI consultant specialising in the sports sector. 

    I’m a proud data nerd with over 10 years of experience across different sectors. I have a Master's degree in Biostatistics and hold PL-300 Microsft Power BI Data Analyst Associate and DP-600 Microsoft Fabric Associate Engineer Certifications. 

    My qualifications and experience as a former decathlete for Great Britain bring a unique blend of analytical skills and sports-specific experience to my work and I understand the intricacies of sports data firsthand.

    As well as building reports, I empower clients by training and upskilling their teams to be self-sufficient in managing and interpreting their data. My goal is to transform your team from data-aware to data-empowered, ensuring they have the expertise to fully leverage their data long after our collaboration.

    Outside of work, I’m an avid fitness enthusiast, with a particular love for windsurfing and squash.
