    Hi, I'm Jack Frank Andrew, a Senior Sports Data Insights Analyst at Aspire Academy. With a solid foundation in Mathematics and a Master's degree in Biostatistics, I bring a unique blend of analytical skills and sports-specific experience to my work. As a former decathlete who represented Great Britain, I understand the intricacies of sports data firsthand. I'm a proud Power BI nerd and aspiring Fabricator, holding Power BI Data Analyst Associate and Fabric Associate Engineer certifications. My deep passion for Power BI was recognized when I won the February 2024 edition of the Maven Analytics Dashboard Challenge. Iâ€™m dedicated to helping people make better use of their data and try my best to train and mentor clients to help them become self-sufficient in their data needs.

    Outside of work, I'm an avid watersports enthusiast, with a particular love for windsurfing. I also enjoy playing squash, staying fit, and spending time outside.
