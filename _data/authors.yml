    Hi, I'm Jack Frank Andrew, a Power BI consultant and the Senior Sports Data Insights Analyst at Aspire Academy in Qatar.
    
    I'm a proud Power BI nerd with over 8 years of experience and hold a Microsft Power BI Data Analyst Associate and Fabric Associate Engineer certifications. I have a Master's degree in Biostatistics and am a former decathlete who represented Great Britain. 
    
    I bring a unique blend of analytical skills and sports-specific experience to my work and understand the intricacies of sports data firsthand.  
    
    Iâ€™m dedicated to helping people make better use of their data and try my best to train and mentor clients to help them become self-sufficient in their data needs.

    Outside of work, I'm an avid watersports enthusiast, with a particular love for windsurfing. I also enjoy playing squash, staying fit, and spending time outside.
