Hello and welcome to my blog!

I’m excited (nervous and apprehensive) to share my ideas and thoughts on all things data—from the latest Power BI and Microsoft Fabric updates to cool data visualization techniques, and everything in between. Whether you’re an experienced data pro or just dipping your toes into the world of data, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity or helps you along your data journey, and, if you have any feedback, please feel free to get in touch as jackfrankandrew@gmail.com.

#### Why Blog?

So, why did I start this blog/portfolio? I want to showcase what I’ve been working on and get feedback from the data community. It’s a space where I can experiment with new ideas, try out different techniques, and keep my skills fresh. Plus (hopefully), sharing what I’ve learned helps me stay connected with the latest trends and tools in the industry. And who knows—maybe something here will inspire you too!

At the start of 2024, I promised myself I would start working on some personal projects, participating in data challenges, and posting a little more on Linkedin. After some research, I found that setting up a portfolio was what a lot of other data professionals had done, so here we are! 

Stay tuned for more updates—I’m just getting started!
