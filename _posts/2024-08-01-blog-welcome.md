Hello and welcome to my blog!

I’m excited to share my thoughts on all things data—from the latest Power BI and Microsoft Fabric updates to cool data visualization techniques, and everything in between. Whether you’re an experienced data pro or just dipping your toes into the world of data, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity and helps you along your data journey.

#### Why Blog?

So, why did I start this blog? Mainly to showcase what I’ve been working on and to get feedback from the data community. It’s a space where I can experiment with new ideas, try out different techniques, and keep my skills fresh. Plus, sharing what I’ve learned helps me stay connected with the latest trends and tools in the industry. And who knows—maybe something here will inspire you too!

Stay tuned for more updates—I’m just getting started!
