## CMJ Adaptive Range Monitoring Dashboard
I developed this dashboard to enhance athlete monitoring. It integrates CMJ (Countermovement Jump) metrics from the VALD ForceDecks system with adaptive ranges using Expectation-Maximization (EM) approximation in Power BI and R.

For more on adaptive ranges using EM approximation click [here](https://lnkd.in/dCurR-uy)

## Project Overview
ðŸ”¹ Data Integration: Imported athlete force plate data from VALD ForceDecks into Power BI.
ðŸ”¹ Statistical Modeling: Used R to apply EM approximation, allowing adaptive reference ranges to evolve dynamically based on individual athlete trends.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Insights: Built a Power BI dashboard to provide longitudinal monitoring of athlete performance, highlighting deviations and trends over time.

## Key Features
âœ… Adaptive Ranges: Automatically adjust based on the athleteâ€™s historical data.
âœ… Seamless Power BI & R Integration: Enables advanced statistical analysis within an interactive Power BI report.
âœ… Scalability: Designed to be easily deployed across teams in an organization.

## Next Steps
ðŸ“Œ Connect directly to the VALD API for real-time, in-session monitoring.
ðŸ“Œ Enable parameter customization for adaptive range calculations.

This project builds on the work of Kenny McMillan PhD and aims to provide a robust, data-driven approach to athlete performance tracking.
