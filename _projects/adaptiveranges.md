## CMJ Adaptive Range Monitoring Dashboard
I developed this dashboard to enhance athlete monitoring. It integrates CMJ (Countermovement Jump) metrics from the VALD ForceDecks system with adaptive ranges using Expectation-Maximization (EM) approximation in Power BI and R.

For more on adaptive ranges using EM approximation click [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247338)

## Project Overview
- **Data Integration:** Imported athlete force plate data from VALD ForceDecks into Power BI.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Used R to apply EM approximation, allowing adaptive reference ranges to evolve dynamically based on individual athlete trends.
- **Visualization & Insights:** Built a Power BI dashboard to provide longitudinal monitoring of athlete performance, highlighting deviations and trends over time.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Ranges:** Automatically adjust based on the athleteâ€™s historical data.
- **Seamless Power BI & R Integration:** Enables advanced statistical analysis within an interactive Power BI report.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be easily deployed across teams in an organization.

## Next Steps
- **Connect directly to the VALD API** for real-time, in-session monitoring.
- **Enable parameter customization** for adaptive range calculations.


This project builds on the great work of [Kenny McMillan PhD](https://lnkd.in/dyUSkZsU) and aims to provide a robust, data-driven approach to athlete performance tracking.
