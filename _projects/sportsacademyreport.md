# Sports Academy End of Term Report

### Objective
The purpose of this project was to design a reporting tool to provide a simple and easy-to-use way for a sports academy to track and analyze testing data. This data can help identify areas where athletes need improvement, track their progress over time, and enable coaches to make informed decisions about training and competition.

### Requirements Gathering
Before designing the tool, requirements were collected from coaches to ensure the solution aligned with their needs for data collection and reporting. The key requirements included:
- A **dashboard** displaying squad-level data such as the best, worst, most improved, and squad records for physical performance scores.
- The ability to generate **printable PDF reports** for each athlete, summarizing individual performance metrics and progress over time.

### Tools Used
The reporting tool was built using **Google Sheets**, as it provided a cost-effective and flexible solution suitable for the academy’s budget and accessible for the end users.

### Features and Benefits
The tool delivers several key benefits for the organization, including:

- **Improved athlete performance:** By tracking and analyzing testing data, coaches can identify areas where athletes need improvement and provide targeted training recommendations.
  
- **Reduced injuries:** By monitoring athletes’ progress over time, coaches can spot early warning signs of potential injuries and take preventative action.

- **Enhanced decision-making:** Access to comprehensive data enables coaches to make more informed decisions about both training plans and competition strategies.

- **Streamlined reporting:** Coaches can easily view and analyze squad-level data via the dashboard, while individualized PDF reports provide a clear summary of each athlete’s performance for end-of-term reviews.

### Implementation
The dashboard allows coaches to quickly visualize and compare squad performance metrics, while the PDF reports offer a detailed summary of each athlete’s progression. Both tools ensure that the coaches have the necessary information to guide training and monitor athlete development effectively.
