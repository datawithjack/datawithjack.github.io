# Sports Academy End of Term Report

### Objective
The purpose of this project was to design a reporting tool to provide a simple and easy-to-use way for a sports academy to track and analyze testing data. This data can identify areas where athletes need improvement, track their progress over time, and make informed decisions about training and competition.

### Tools
The reporting tool was built in Google Sheets as this provided a cost-effective and flexible solution, given the budget, for the academy and was suitable given the nature of the end users.

### Benefits
The benefits brought to the organization through this tool included:

* **Improved athlete performance:** By tracking and analyzing testing data, coaches can identify areas where athletes need improvement and make targeted training recommendations.

* **Reduced injuries:** By tracking athletes' progress over time, coaches can identify potential injuries and take steps to prevent them.

* **Improved decision-making:** By having access to data, coaches can make more informed decisions about training and competition.
